From October 2015 - April 2016 I was enrolled in the Galvanize Full Stack Web and Software Development Program. It was a very demanding six months to say the least. One of the things that kept my motivation high was listening to inspiring speeches and podcasts first thing in the morning. With that in mind, I undertook a fun little weekend project to create a simple, beautiful page full of inspirational quotes and videos.

Though 'positive thinking' is often seen as a soft touchy-feeling term, research is beginning to reveal that positive thinking is about much more than just being happy or displaying an upbeat attitude. Positive thoughts can actually create real value in your life and help you build skills that last much longer than a smile. With all of the media we consume nowadays, it is important the we program our brains rather than let them be programmed. I created shootforthe.top to be a quick shot of positive affirmation for anyone who needs it. 

The page itself is rather simple and was written in plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is largely driven by functions that randomize the order of quotes shown as well as the cycling of curated background colors whenever the "NEW QUOTE" button is clicked.

It features a different layout optimized for mobile viewing. On page open, it prompts the use to turn their device sideways, then use their thumb to cycle through quotes.

The name itself came pretty arbitrarily. I saw that ".top" domain names were on sle for 88 cents and decided to choose a name that would fit well with the domain!

I hope you've found this little project of mine fun and hopefully useful as well!
